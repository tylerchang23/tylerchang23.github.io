My name is Tyler Chang, and I'm an incoming senior at UC Davis, pursuing a double
major in Statistics and Economics.

I started at UC Davis having no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Ironically,
I came across the term "data science" by chance. I was scrolling through the
NBA sub-Reddit one night, and came across a post that analyzed Kobe Bryant's
basketball career. The data set had every single field goal attempt Kobe took
in 20 YEARS. Each shot also specified how far it was from the basket, how much
time was left, who he was playing, and so much more. With this information, the
data scientist was able to predict which shots Kobe was most likely to make. His
predictions were crazy accurate too. I remember watching Kobe in awe growing up,
telling my dad all the time, "That one's going in!" It was amazing to see that
other people think about these things, and that there actually is a science to
figuring these kinds of things out.

There is a certain beauty to data science that keeps me hooked. The thing I love
the most is that data science can be applied anywhere. From genetics to economics,
social media to politics, and even to basketball, the power of data lies in all
aspects of life. With three years of undergrad under my belt, I still have only
touched the surface of the data science world. However, with those three years
I have gained a wide variety of skills that have prepared me greatly. The purpose
of my portfolio is to showcase those skills, and present what I am most passionate
about. I still have much to learn, but this is where it starts.
