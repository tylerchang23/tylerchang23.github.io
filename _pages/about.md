Hello! I'm Tyler and I am an aspiring data scientist. I graduated from UC Davis
this past June with a double major in Statistics (Data Science Track)
and Economics (Data Analytics Track). As we all manage to get through these
truly unprecedented times, I am one of the many recent grads that is frantically
looking for work. Through this portfolio, I hope to showcase my skill set and
passion for data science.
