## Introduction

In today’s society, gun violence continues to be an increasingly pressing issue.  In 2017 alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) reported that there are 36,000 gun deaths per year, an average of 100 deaths per day.  CBS news reported that there have already been 346 mass shootings in the U.S. in 2019 with about a month to go.  Furthermore, the CDCP reported that over half of suicide deaths resulted from a firearm.  This unprecedented and disturbing trend in gun violence has many citizens across the U.S. wondering what could be causing this.

In this project, we will analyze monthly handgun sales and firearms related deaths in California from 1980 to 1998.  There are 2 columns in the data frame, with the first being gun sales and the second being firearm deaths (per 100,000).  

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to utilize the time series data to **determine a relationship between gun sales and gun related deaths**.

## Tools:

* **Languages**: *R*
* **Libraries**: *astsa*

## Differencing to obtain stationarity

After plotting the time series of both features (***Figure 1***), we can observe a trend in the data and possibly a seasonal effect.  This trend indicates that the values of each observation are dependent on time, proving that both series are not stationary.  This trend and lack of stationarity also indicates that both processes do not have mean zero and constant variance.  Since the series are not stationary, we are not yet able to perform typical time series analysis techniques.

</p>

Although the processes are not stationary, there are several methods to turn non-stationary time series into stationary ones.  One of these methods, differencing, involves subtracting the previous observation from the previous one.  Differencing can be used to remove the general trend of the data, as well as any seasonal effects.

The plot in ***Figure 2*** shows the time series after performing 1 time differencing on both processes.  It appears that the first order time differencing eliminated the obvious trend that the processes previously possessed.  Although this initial trend may have been eliminated, the plots appear to have a seasonal trend lurking.  In particular, there appears to be a seasonal trend at approximately every 12 time lags (i.e. 1 year).  To now eliminate this seasonal component of the time series, we can now perform a seasonal differencing on both models.

</p>

After applying seasonal differencing at multiples of lag 12, the time series plots are displayed in ***Figure 3***.  It appears now that both processes have achieved stationarity.  For both time series, there appears to be approximately zero mean and approximately constant variance- the two conditions for stationarity.

## Determining models through ACF & PCF

After transforming the data into a stationary form, we can now determine a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model for the processes by observing the Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) and Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF).

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/gunTSA_images/fig4.png" alt="plot">

<p align = "center">
<i><strong>Figure 4</strong></i>
</p>

***Figure 4*** shows the ACF and PACF of the gun sales data.  Determining a SARIMA model for the data can be broken down into two steps.  First, we must determine the non-seasonal component of the model by observing patterns within a 12 lag period.  Specifically noting the first period, it appears (approximately) that the ACF cuts off after lag 2 and the PACF tails off.  This indicates that the non-seasonal component of the model can be represented with an MA(2) process.

Similarly, the seasonal component of the model can be determined by observing the ACF and PACF of the data at every multiple of lag 12.  From this, notice that the ACF tails off and the PACF cuts off at lag r = 3.  Thus, we can represent the seasonal component of the model as an AR(3) process.

Thus, I obtained the model for **sales** with the following results:

|Coefficient     | Estimate     | Standard Error     | t-value    | p-value     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| ma1     | -0.2252     | 0.0675     | -3.3374     | 0.001     |
| ma2     | -0.2942     | 0.0682    | -4.3164       | 0.000     |
| sar1     | -0.6154    | 0.0673    | -9.1431     | 0.000     |
| sar2    | -0.5712      | 0.0668     | -8.5468     | 0.000    |
| sar3    | -0.2944     | 0.0658    | -4.4717     | 0.000     |


| Information Criteria     | Value     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| AIC       | 7.621455       |
| AICc       | 7.622673       |
| BIC      | 7.711214       |

Determining how to exactly model a SARIMA model based on the ACF and PACF alone is a difficult task.  As a result, I was interested in testing different models “close” to the model I chose, by alternating values of p, q, P, and Q.  Trying different models with different values of p, q, P and Q, it can be observed that some of these models actually have smaller information criteria values.  However, each of these models with smaller values for information criteria had at least one coefficient that was not statistically significant.  In fact, the original model that we chose was one of the only models that had coefficients that were all statistically significant.  Therefore, we can be more confident that our model for sales is an appropriate one.

</p>

Following a similar procedure to sales, we can determine a SARIMA model for deaths using the plots of the ACF and PACF shown in ***Figure 5***.  The non-seasonal part shows the ACF cuts off at lag 1 and the PACF tails off, which is indicative of a MA(1) process.  Furthermore, the seasonal component shows the ACF cuts off at lag r = 1 and the PACF tails off, which is also implying a MA(1) should be used.

Thus, I obtained this model for **deaths** with the following results:

|Coefficient     | Estimate     | Standard Error     | t-value    | p-value     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| ma1     | -0.6286     | 0.0643     | -9.7704     | 0.000     |
| sma1     | -1.0000     | 0.1064    | -9.3950       | 0.000     |


| Information Criteria     | Value     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| AIC       | -1.856231      |
| AICc       | -1.855991       |
| BIC      | 1.811351       |

## Diagnostics

After fitting a model for each of the series, it is important to check model diagnostics to ensure that the model is actually an appropriate one.

<i><strong>Figure 6</strong></i>
</p>

Displayed in ***Figure 6*** are diagnostic plots for sales outputted by R’s built-in SARIMA function.  It appears that the model is a good fit.  In particular, there does not appear to be a trend in the standardized residuals.  Also, the ACF of the residuals does not appear to have a significant dependence structure.  Although the Q-Q plot does show the existence of outliers, the sample quantiles typically tend to the theoretical quantiles, showing that the normality assumption is met.  Furthermore, most of the p-values in the Ljung-Box plot appear to be statistically significant.

Similarly, displayed in ***Figure 7*** are diagnostic plots for deaths.  It appears that the model selected is also a good fit.  In particular, there does not appear to be a trend in the standardized residuals.  Also, the ACF of the residuals does not appear to have a significant dependence structure.  In contrast to the model fitted for sales, the Q-Q plot does not show the existence of outliers, the sample quantiles typically tend to the theoretical quantiles, showing that the normality assumption is met.  Furthermore, most of the p-values in the Ljung-Box plot appear to be statistically significant.

## Dependence among sales & deaths

After determining the SARIMA models for sales and deaths individually, we are now interested in finding a potential dependence among them.  To determine if there is a dependency between sales and deaths, one can examine the cross correlation function (CCF).  In general, the CCF of any two series can show whether one series “leads” the other, i.e. one process can be predicted by the other.

From the CCF plotted in ***Figure 8***, it appears that there is no truly dominant peak in the CCF at any specific time lag.  It is not very clear from the CCF that one time series can predict the other since there is no obvious, significant peak.  Therefore, we must obtain another method to try to discover a dependency.

</p>

Since we were unable to determine a “leading” relationship between sales and deaths, we now turn to linear regression.  After running linear regression with sales (Y) and deaths (x), at first glance it seems like the new model is a good one, with the model having statistically significant coefficients. Although it seems that this model is appropriate, we can observe from the time series plot of the residuals that the errors are autocorrelated (***Figure 9***), violating one of the model's core assumptions.  Therefore, we must now obtain a model that accounts for these autocorrelated errors.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/gunTSA_images/fig9.png" alt="plot">

<p align = "center">
<i><strong>Figure 9</strong></i>
</p>

After performing first order differencing and seasonal differencing at every r = 12 lags, the residuals appear to be stationary (***Figure 10***), meaning the transformed residuals are no longer autocorrelated.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/gunTSA_images/fig10.png" alt="plot">

<p align = "center">
<i><strong>Figure 10</strong></i>
</p>

In order to model the behavior of the residuals, we again observe the plots of the ACF and PACF (***Figure 11***).

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/gunTSA_images/fig11.png" alt="plot">

<p align = "center">
<i><strong>Figure 11</strong></i>
</p>

Following a similar procedure to when we determined SARIMA models for sales and deaths, we observe that the transformed residuals can be modelled as an SARIMA(0,1,1)x(2,1,0).  Without displaying the output (see Code Appendix), each coefficient of this model is indeed statistically significant and the diagnostic plots (***Figure 12***).

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/gunTSA_images/fig12.png" alt="plot">

<p align = "center">
<i><strong>Figure 12</strong></i>
</p>

To obtain a new linear model with uncorrelated errors, we determine a SARIMA model for deaths (Y) given the parameters for the SARIMA model for the residuals.

|Coefficient     | Estimate     | Standard Error     | t-value    | p-value     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| ma1     | -0.7684    | 0.0574     | -13.3889      | 0.0000    |
| sar1     | -0.6591    | 0.0686    | -9.6075    | 0.000     |
| sar2    | -0.2553      | 0.0710     | -3.5960     | 0.0004   |
| xreg   | 0.0010     | 0.0004    | 2.4484    | 0.0152    |

As a result, we can observe that the results are statistically significant.  In particular, we see that the regression coefficient the resulting coefficient is 0.0010, and there is no regression coefficient since we are not interested in centering the data.

$$Y_t = 0.0001x_t + \epsilon_t, \epsilon_t ~ WN(0, \sigma^2)$$

## Summary
We began the analysis by first examining each time series individually.  After utilizing various differencing techniques, we observed the ACF and PACF of each series to determine a SARIMA model for each variable.  We were then interested in comparing our candidate model to other models with SARIMA parameters “close” to each candidate.  It appeared that there were models that had smaller information criteria values, and could potentially be a more appropriate model than the candidate.  However, these models commonly had at least one statistically insignificant SARIMA coefficient, so in fact our model was more appropriate.

After examining each series individually, we now wanted to develop a linear regression model to use the time series of sales to predict the time series of death.  The errors of the fitted linear model appeared to be autocorrelated, so we first had to transform the errors to remove the autocorrelation.  Following a similar procedure to finding models for sales and deaths, we then determined a SARIMA model for the linear model’s residuals.  Finally, we were able to fit another SARIMA model for deaths using the same parameters as the SARIMA model for the residuals to obtain a regression coefficient sales in the linear model.

One of the main goals of this project was to determine if a relationship exists between firearm deaths and gun sales.  After careful examination we were able to develop a linear model which shows there is indeed a positive relationship between firearm deaths and gun sales.

It is worth mentioning that although there is a positive relationship between firearm deaths and gun sales, is not the only relationship that exists.  There are many factors that go into the number of firearm deaths, not just gun sales.  Thus, politicians should take gun sales into consideration when determining the various gun control laws.
