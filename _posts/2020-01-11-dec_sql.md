## Introduction

After being on the job hunt for some time now, I've gone through my fair share of job postings on LinkedIn. When you search up terms like *Data Analyst* and *Data Scientist*, you'll often see similar skills needed for those types of roles. Probably the most prevalent skill I see is **SQL**. From my personal experience (and others), SQL is rarely utilized in most data science undergrad programs. At my school, I vaguely remember *one* class spending at most *a week* on SQL. We learned a couple of aggregate functions and joins, but nothing too fancy.

When I graduated and started looking for work, I began to realize that my SQL level was nowhere near where it needed to be. As I started to hear back from companies, the company would usually send a preliminary assessment on a whole variety of things. Whenever I reached the SQL portion of the assessment, I would be Googling endlessly to unconsciously regurgitate something kind of related and pray that it would be good enough. Yeah... it wasn't good enough.

A couple of weeks into my job search, I made the decision to really grind out learn SQL. I used a whole bunch of resources- Coursera, books, Youtube, etc.. It was a lot of talking to myself like a mad man, frustration, and moments of immense satisfaction. After a few months, I started to really get the hang of the fundamentals and the basic flow of the language. Though I made a *huge* leap from a few months prior, I still found myself struggling in interview type settings. Though my fundamental understanding was pretty good, I feel like I needed to now figure out how SQL was being asked in *actual interviews*.

That's where the *December SQL Challenge* was born. In the month of December, I challenged myself to do at least one SQL problem on LeetCode everyday. One convenience of LeetCode Premium (Yes, I paid the $35), is that you can see the frequency of certain problems in real interviews. Naturally, I sorted the problems by frequency (ASCENDING) and challenged myself to go down this list.

# The Process

Whenever I'm coding, in any language, it's crucial for me to understand where *everything* comes from. For that reason, I allowed myself to do 1-2 questions a day so I could really sit down with each of the problems. When I first started, I would try to brute force my way through the problem- figure out which features were needed from which tables, throw a couple JOINs in there, and filter along the way. Though sometimes I would get lucky, I came to realize that this approach wasn't really teaching me anything. To fix this, I started to "whiteboard" all of my ideas before I started coding anything. Although it did take more time to physically write down my thought process and code, this gave me the opportunity to visualize what my code was actually doing!

Whenever I finished coding a problem, I would go through the code and verbally go through the logic line by line. I found that I truly mastered a problem when I could translate the code into real words. Every day before starting a new problem, I would revisit and review yesterday's problem to see if the logic stuck with me.

# Reflection

After 31 days of repetition and hard work, I definitely feel a lot more confident with my SQL ability. The repetition was a big reason for my growth. After the first week, I started to pick up on some common patterns/techniques used in a lot of the questions. From there, the questions started to get easier and I was able to fully explain my solutions to my peers (Thanks Austin for all of the mock interviews). I'm super glad I did this challenge, and I will continue to keep practicing!
