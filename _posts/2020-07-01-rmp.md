## Introduction

When I was in college, it was crucial that I had a good professor to succeed in the class. Unlike many of my friends who could easily self-learn the class, I was the kid who was at every office hours asking questions from start to finish. As a result, it was drastically important that I could have one-on-one time with someone who could explain the material to my liking.

One tool that I used throughout my college career was the review site, *RateMyProfessors*. Here, I could go through hundreds of reviews to find the best professors for a class in a given quarter. Personally, RMP did a pretty good job at giving an overall rundown of what to expect from a professor. Going into a class where I knew the professor was highly rated, I rarely was let down. In this project, I wanted to validate my personal experience with the actual data.

## Goals

I wanted to answer a couple of different questions with this analysis:

* **How were students talking about my old professors?**
* **What do students look for in a good professor?**
* **Which schools in the UC system get more positive reviews?**

Apart from this exploratory analysis, I also hoped to **develop a model that can classify whether a review will be good or bad**.

## Tools (Python)

* **Data Collection:** *BeautifulSoup*
* **Natural Language Processing:** *CountVectorizer, re, TextBlob*
* **Data Manipulation/Pre-processing:** *Pandas, NumPy*
* **Data Visualization:** *Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud*
* **Machine Learning:** *Sklearn*

## Results

***How were students talking about my old professors?***

After compiling the reviews for some of my old professors, I found the words/short phrases (tokens) that were commonly found in their reviews, as shown in the WordClouds below! The left side shows the most frequent tokens for one of my best professors at UC Davis, who has an overall quality of 4.5 (out of 5). The flip side shows a professor whose class I performed poorly in. From personal experience, I think these were fairly accurate when describing these professors and their classes. It was interesting to see the shift in tone between a seemingly "good" professor and "bad" professor.
