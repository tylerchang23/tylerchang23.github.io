## Introduction

When I was in college, it was crucial that I had a good professor to succeed in the class. Unlike many of my friends who could easily self-learn the class, I was the kid who was at every office hours asking questions from start to finish. As a result, it was drastically important that I could have one-on-one time with someone who could explain the material to my liking.

One tool that I used throughout my college career was the review site, *RateMyProfessors*. Here, I could go through hundreds of reviews to find the best professors for a class in a given quarter. Personally, RMP did a pretty good job at giving an overall rundown of what to expect from a professor. Going into a class where I knew the professor was highly rated, I rarely was let down. In this project, I wanted to validate my personal experience with the actual data.

## Goals

I wanted to answer a couple of different questions with this analysis:

* **How were students talking about my old professors?**
* **What do students look for in a good professor?**
* **Which schools in the UC system get more positive reviews?**

Apart from this exploratory analysis, I also hoped to **develop a model that can classify whether a review will be good or bad**.

## Tools (Python)

* **Data Collection:** *BeautifulSoup*
* **Natural Language Processing:** *CountVectorizer, re, TextBlob*
* **Data Manipulation/Pre-processing:** *pandas, numpy*
* **Data Visualization:** *matplotlib, seaborn, WordCloud*
* **Machine Learning:** *sklearn*
