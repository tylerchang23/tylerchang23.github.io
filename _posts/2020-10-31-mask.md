## Introduction

In the age of COVID-19, [studies](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v4) have shown the effectiveness of masks in slowing down the spread of the virus. With health experts around the globe expecting a second wave to hit, it is crucial that we play our role in stopping the spread by social distancing and wearing masks in public. Almost every local restaurant and store in the Bay Area require masks upon entry, but there is a slim chance that there is an assigned mask checker waiting at the door.

I created a web application that can classify whether or not a person is wearing a proper face covering. After scraping hundreds of images off of Instagram, I used the *fast.ai* framework to create a convolutional neural network for image classification. After fine-tuning the model, I was able to achieve **95% validation accuracy**. My hope is to inspire businesses to incorporate this type of technology in the future to protect their employees and their customers!

My web app was featured and part of [Code With Friends](https://codewithfriends.io/), "a month-long coding event where folks from all over the world work on their personal coding projects together." I had two main goals at the start of this challenge. **1) Get my feet wet with deep learning**. As an aspiring data scientist, I feel like deep learning and AI were always areas that were quite interesting, but also quite intimidating to me. Especially since there was no AI required courses for Statistics majors at my university, I truly didn't know where to start. Thankfully, I came across [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/), a *free* and extremely hands-on course created by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/). The course instructor, Jeremy Howard, completely demystified deep learning for me with his elegant teaching style and the awesome *fast.ai* framework. **2) Put a model into production**. For a long time, I have wanted to deploy one of my data science projects so that I could show it off to my friends and family. Until now, I thought that I needed to know JavaScript, Swift, Django, or some other foreign entity that wasn't in my repertoire. Luckily, I was able to find a clever work-around with a Jupyter Notebook to create my first web app! I am extremely grateful to the *Code With Friends team* and *fastai* for helping me achieve my goals!
